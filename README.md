# GitHub Templates
The easiest, fastest way to start a dev project.

Until now, we've created every project from scratch.  But shouldn't we keep it DRY (don't repeat yourself)?
Since most front-end web projects start with the same files, what if we made a repo with our basic folder/file structure and cloned it when we needed to start a new project?  Sounds like it would save a lot of time and potential headache!

Luckily for us, GitHub already thought of that and named it GitHub Templates.

To complete the coding challenge:
1. Create a repo with the following files: index.html, style.css, main.js.
2. In index.html, make a basic HTML document (like when using the "!" shortcut in VS Code).
3. Add the Bootstrap CSS to the head of index.html.
4. Load main.js in to index.html by using the script tag just above the closing body tag.
5. Make the repository a template: [Creating a template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-template-repository)
6. Make a repo from your template: [Creating a repository from a template](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
7. Clone the repo you made in Step 6 by clicking "Code" and then "Open in GitHub Desktop"
8. From GitHub Desktop, click "Open in Visual Studio Code."
9. From Visual Studio Code, go to File -> Save Workspace As
10. Marvel at how much time you're about to save.

If you finish early, see what else you can add to your template, like a basic Bootstrap grid with a responsive image.

P.S., the repo you're viewing has my actual starting template for front-end web projects for client work.  I keep CSS, JavaScript, and images in separate files, but you can set yours up in any way you want.  We will spend quite a bit of time in VS Code, so it's important to make yourself comfortable!
